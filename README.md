# Progressive Transfer learning for Face Anti Spoofing

## Introduction
The project replicates the findings of the research paper "Progressive Transfer Learning for Face Anti-Spoofing" by R. Quan et al., published in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (2021), DOI: 10.1109/TIP.2021.3066912.

Face Anti-Spoofing System Using CNN (ResNet-18) | PyTorch, Deep Learning

This project focuses on enhancing face authentication security by implementing a progressive learning approach for face anti-spoofing, based on a CNN architecture (ResNet-18). The model leverages both labeled and pseudo-labeled data in a semi-supervised learning setup to iteratively improve performance. This approach has demonstrated enhanced robustness against attacks from unseen faces, surpassing traditional supervised methods in handling domain shifts.

Keywords: Face recognition, Transfer learning, Progressive learning, Face anti-spoofing, Semi-supervised learning, CNN, ResNet-18.

## Dataset
The dataset should be organized into `train`, `val`, and `test` directories, each containing subdirectories for each class (e.g., `living` and `spoofing`).
