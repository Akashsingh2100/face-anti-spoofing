# Progressive Transfer learning for Face Anti Spoofing

## Introduction
Face anti-spoofing is a crucial task for secure face authentication systems.This project implements a progressive learning approach for face anti-spoofing using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on ResNet-18. The model is trained with both labeled and pseudo-labeled data to improve its performance iteratively.it semi-supervised learning approach which is more robust to prevent attact from unseen faces compared to state of the art supervised model.



## Dataset
The dataset should be organized into `train`, `val`, and `test` directories, each containing subdirectories for each class (e.g., `living` and `spoofing`).
